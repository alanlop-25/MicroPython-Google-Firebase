# ESP32 with Micropython 
# DHT11 measurement and Google Firebase Data Adquisition

In this repository you will be able to adquire temperature and humidity measurements through the DHT11 sensor
However, the data will be saved in a local .txt file, showed in an OLED display and will be sent to a Firebase Data base

The code is pretty basic and for practical purposes, the requirements you will need are:

* Download both libraries (urequests.py and ssd1306big.py)
* 2.4GHz WiFi connection
* Google firebase DataBase
* DHT11 sensor
* 128x64 OLED Display
* ESP32 microcontroller

The data is measured and sent every 5 seconds
